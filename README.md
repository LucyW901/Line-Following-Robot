# Line-Following-Robot
I made a line following robot with a partner following my high school teacher's supervision. The hardware configuration is done with the help of mp lab tutorial. Due to the reason of the course, I can't upload the code, however, I uploaded the video of the robot and the algorithm we used will be briefly explained in below. 
The algorithm used: There are two light sensor mounted right in the middle of the robot, placed at the width of the line. When the right sensot detects white, the right wheel is slowed down and vice versa. Two light sensors are added at the end of the robot so that it could detect the loner terminal line and decides whether it should go back or not. However, one thing is that all the values at the boundary need to be tested in variuos condition and various time. (Heavily depends on the physical condition.)
The hardware: the hardware comes from the mp lab package but some additional part may need to be purchased. For example, for the robot to go back, we added one more light sensor to detected the terminal line.
